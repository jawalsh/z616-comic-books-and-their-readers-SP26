## Online Discussion: Fan Cultures and Fan Communities

**Reading:** Kristina Busse and Jonathan Gray, “Fan Cultures and Fan Communities” (2011)

**Assignment (Reading Response, Canvas Post)**

Before class, complete the assigned reading carefully. As you read, take notes and mark passages, concepts, or arguments that you find especially interesting, challenging, or generative.

Before the session, post a **2–3 paragraph response** (approximately 300–400 words) to Canvas. Your post should present a **specific, original reflection** grounded in the reading and written in clear academic prose (introductory sentence, coherent development, concluding insight).

### Prompt

Busse and Gray argue that fan studies has shifted over time in how it understands fans, fandom, and fan communities. Choose **one concept, distinction, or tension** from the reading that you found especially interesting, troubling, or productive.

Briefly explain how the authors frame this issue, then use a **specific example** (from the reading or from a real fandom you are familiar with) to reflect on **what is gained—or lost—by thinking about fandom in this way**.

You may also reflect briefly on how this framing might shape how scholars **study, document, or represent fan activity**, but this is optional.
