## Online Discussion: Studying Fandom from the Inside

**Readings:**
- Carolyn Ellis, Tony E. Adams, and Arthur P. Bochner, *“Autoethnography: An Overview”* (2011)  
- Benjamin Woo, *“Asking Fans Questions: The Ethnographic Interview”* (2021)  

**Assignment (Reading Response, Canvas Post)**

Before class, complete the assigned readings carefully. As you read, take notes and mark passages, concepts, or arguments that you find especially interesting, challenging, or generative.

Before the session, post a **2–3 paragraph response** (approximately 300–400 words) to Canvas. Your post should present a **specific, original reflection** grounded in the readings and written in clear academic prose (introductory sentence, coherent development, concluding insight).

### Prompt

Last week, we looked at fandom studies as an academic field and at how scholars have conceptualized fans and fan communities. This week shifts focus to **how researchers study fandom in practice**, especially when they are close to—or part of—the cultures they analyze.

Choose **one concept, tension, or methodological commitment** from the readings (for example: positionality, insider/outsider status, relational ethics, narrative truth, or the goals of ethnographic interviewing) that you found especially compelling, difficult, or unsettling.

Briefly explain how the author(s) frame this issue, then use a **specific example** (from the readings or from a fandom or cultural community you are familiar with) to reflect on **what this approach makes possible—and what risks, blind spots, or complications it introduces**.

You may conclude by reflecting on how this way of studying fandom might shape the kinds of questions scholars ask, the kinds of evidence they value, or the kinds of stories they are able to tell.
