**Readings:**  
- Elizabeth O’Brien, “Zines: A Personal History” (2012)

## Assignment (Reading Response, Canvas Post)

Before class, complete the assigned readings carefully. As you read, take notes and mark passages, concepts, or arguments that you find especially interesting, challenging, or generative.

Before the session, post a 2–3 paragraph response (approximately 300–400 words) to Canvas. Your post should present a specific, original reflection grounded in the readings and written in clear academic prose (introductory sentence, coherent development, concluding insight).

## Prompt

This week’s readings approach fan production from three different angles:  

- O’Brien reflects on zine-making as intimate, vulnerable, and materially situated.  
- Schelly historicizes fanzines as foundational to organized comic fandom.  
- Ratto theorizes “critical making” as a way of linking material production to conceptual reflection.

Choose **one key idea, tension, or claim** from any of the readings (or from the conversation among them) that you find especially productive.

In your response:

1. Briefly explain how the author frames this issue.  
2. Use a specific example (from the readings or from a fan practice you are familiar with) to explore what making—whether zines, fanzines, or technical prototypes—*does* socially or intellectually.  

You might consider questions such as:

- What does the *materiality* of zines enable that digital platforms do not?  
- How does fan publishing function as community-building, gatekeeping, self-fashioning, or historical documentation?  
- In what sense can making itself be a form of theory or critique?  
- What is the relationship between vulnerability and circulation in fan-produced media?  
- Does “critical making” describe what zine-makers are already doing, or does it imply something different?

You may also reflect briefly on how these readings might shape how scholars study fan artifacts (e.g., as texts, as objects, as social networks, as methods).
