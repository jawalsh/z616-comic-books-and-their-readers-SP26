## In class

- Upcoming assignment: [Tales from the Crypt](assignment-tales-from-the-crypt.md)
- Discussion
- [Paratext lecture and comics examples](https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/gnrlfs/tr/walsh_comic_book_paratexts.pdf)
- **Exploring paratexts activity**  

	We will spend time in class individually looking for interesting examples of comic book paratexts. Try to find two or three distinct examples. 

	Consider the paratexts as evidence of:

	- the commercial and cultural context of the comic books (e.g., advertisements);
	- the creation and production of comic books (e.g., editorial and promotional materials);
	
	Keep notes about your paratext regarding where it came from (title, issue, date) and why it is significant.

	After working individually, we will get together in small groups to share our findings, and then groups will report back to the full class.

	Sources for finding paratexts: 
	* comics in our shared OneDrive folder
	* [Digital Comic Museum](http://digitalcomicmuseum.com/) (DCM)
	* [Comic Book +](https://comicbookplus.com)
	* [Internet Archive](http://archive.org)
