# Fan Activity: An Autoethnographic Exercise

## Overview

For this assignment, you will participate in a fan activity and analyze that experience as a short **autoethnography**.

You are not simply completing a fan activity.  
You are conducting research on your own participation in fandom.

This means you will act as both:

- **Participant** (engaged in the activity), and  
- **Researcher** (observing, documenting, and analyzing your experience).

Your goal is to transform lived experience into analytical insight about fandom.

---

## Step 1: Participate in a Fan Activity

Choose one of the following (or propose an alternative):

- Submit one or more substantive letters/emails to a comic book publication.
- Attend a comic book convention, such as:
  - [Indiana Comic Convention](https://indianacomicconvention.com)
  - [C2E2](https://www.c2e2.com/)
  - [Great Lakes Comic Convention](https://www.greatlakescomicconvention.com)
  - [Lexington Comic and Toy Convention](http://www.lexingtoncomiccon.com/)
  - [Quad Con](https://quadcitycon.com)
  - [Fan Expo Cleveland](https://fanexpohq.com/fanexpocleveland/)
  - [FantastiCon](https://www.fantasticon.net)
  - more at <https://comic-cons.xyz> and <http://www.conventionscene.com/schedules/comicbookconventions/>
- Engage in substantive online interaction with comic creators or fans (e.g., discussion threads, social media exchanges, forum participation).

“Substantive” means meaningful engagement — not a brief comment or passive attendance.

---

## Step 2: Document Your Participation

You must submit documentation of your activity. Examples include:

- Copies of letters or emails you submitted
- Screenshots of online discussions
- Photographs from an event
- A scan/photo of a convention badge
- Other evidence of participation

Documentation demonstrates that your experience is grounded in observable activity.

## Step 3: Write a Short Autoethnographic Analysis (Approx. 500–750 Words)

This is not a diary entry or a reaction post.

Your essay should move from **description → reflection → analysis**.

### Description (What Happened?)
Briefly describe:

- The setting
- The interaction(s)
- The atmosphere
- Key moments
- Specific language or exchanges

Use concrete detail. Specificity builds credibility.

---

### Reflexivity (What Was Your Position?)

You must explicitly address your **positionality**:

- Are you an insider or outsider to this fandom?
- What expectations did you bring?
- How did your identity (experience level, age, gender, expertise, etc.) shape your experience?
- How did your presence influence what happened?

Remember:  
Your perspective shapes what you see.

---

### Analysis (What Does This Reveal About Fandom?)

Move beyond “I experienced X” to:

- What norms were visible?
- What hierarchies or forms of gatekeeping appeared?
- What signs of belonging or exclusion emerged?
- How did commerce, performance, identity, or expertise function?
- How does this connect to concepts from class (participatory culture, fan communities, commercialization, etc.)?

Every descriptive section should lead toward interpretation.

Ask yourself:
> What would someone learn about fandom from this experience?

## What Strong Autoethnography Looks Like

Strong submissions:

- Balance narrative and analysis
- Make positionality visible
- Use specific examples
- Connect experience to course concepts
- Draw broader insight from particular moments

Weak submissions:

- Simply describe what happened
- Focus only on whether you “liked” the experience
- Avoid analysis of power, norms, or structure
- Ignore your own role in shaping the interaction

---

## Submission

Submit a single PDF or Word document in Canvas that includes:

1. Documentation of your activity  
2. Your autoethnographic essay  

---

## Final Reminder

Access to fandom is not the same as understanding fandom.

Your task is to use your own experience as data — and turn that data into insight.
