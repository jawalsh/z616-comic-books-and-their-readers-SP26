### Fanzine production activity
- Prepare for the fanzine production activity:
	- Communicate with your group about fanzine topics, features, and ideas
	- Generate text and gather images for your fanzine
	- Bring any crafting supplies you'd like to work with in class as you make your fanzine with your group. I will bring large sheets of blank paper, markers, crayons, scissors, and a few old comics to cut up, but feel free to bring additional supplies.
