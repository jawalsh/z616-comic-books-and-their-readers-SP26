### Fanzine production activity
- Prepare for the fanzine production activity:
	- You may use the time in class to brainstorm, plan, organize, and gather materials form the internet for your fanzine.
	- If you want to actually work on making the fanzine in class:  
		- If working with a partner, communicate with your partner about fanzine topics, features, and ideas
		- Generate text and gather images for your fanzine
		- Bring any crafting supplies you'd like to work with in class as you make your fanzine with your group. I will bring large sheets of blank paper, markers, crayons, scissors, and a few old comics to cut up, but feel free to bring additional supplies.
