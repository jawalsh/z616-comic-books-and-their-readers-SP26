### How to Read the Week 1 Materials

These readings are assigned **before our first class meeting** and serve a specific purpose:

They are **not methods readings**.

Instead, they are meant to orient you to:
- comics as a medium and cultural form,
- comics readers as historically and socially situated,
- the idea that readers and audiences are legitimate objects of scholarly study.

As you read, focus on **big-picture understanding**, not mastery of details.

In particular, consider the following questions:
- How do these authors define *comics* and *comic books*?
- What assumptions do they make about *who* comics readers are (or have been)?
- What kinds of evidence do they use to talk about readers?
- What kinds of evidence or voices seem absent?

You do **not** need to memorize terms or arguments.  
You *do* need a working familiarity with how comics studies frames its object and its audiences.

Beginning in Week 2, we will shift our focus from *what comics and comics readers are* to *how scholars study fans and readers*, using specific research methods.
