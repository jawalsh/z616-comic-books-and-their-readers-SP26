# Week 6: text analysis

## Summary
This week we will learn about imaging and OCR tools for converting images of comics, fanzines, and similar documents to searchable text, and we will learn about and use a few text analysis tools to analyze textual data about comics and comics readers.

## Weekly Learning Objectives
- *Use* image-capture and OCR tools to *convert* images of comic book letters of comment pages into searchable text.
- *Use* Voyant to *analyze* a corpus of letters of comment.
- *Use* AntConc to *analyze* a corpus of letters of comment
- *Use* Mallet to *generate* topic models from a corpus of letters of comment.
