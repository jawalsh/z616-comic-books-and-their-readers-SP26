## Discussion: Paratext show and tell

In one or more paragraphs:
- Explain what the paratext is, its function, and its location. 
- Discuss how the paratext relates (or does not relate) to the comics content. 
- Include an image or screen capture of the paratext.
- Respond with substantive comments or questions to at least one peers.
- Submit your work in the Canvas [discussion](https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204459/discussion_topics/13437195)
